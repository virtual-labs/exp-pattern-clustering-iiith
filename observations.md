During the course of performance of the experiments, we understand the following:
- The number of iterations help in capturing the pattern in an efficient way. But the network weights generally saturate after some iterations.
- There is no significant change in the weight values of the nodes of CLNN after some iterations.
- There cannot be an accurate capture of pattern, but a better approximation can be reached with more nodes in the network.
